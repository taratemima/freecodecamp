    <p>We'll have a form, where you can put an email address. This will have placeholder text and a way to validate it. Also, a submit button</p>
    <p>My product landing page should have at least one media query. The external CSS will also use flexbox, but we will see if that counts.</p>

  <footer>I'm your only storyteller who needs an attorney.</footer>
